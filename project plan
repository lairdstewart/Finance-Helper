Plan:
    personal_finance class
        Import debit card statement xlsx file
        Import each line of the xlsx file into a new transaction class

        methods:
        total net balance
        monthly net balance
        print transactions
        print monthly transactions

    transaction class with
        - int day
        - int month
        - int year
        - String type: "withdraw" or "deposit"
        - String description
        - int value

TODO

DONE:
average expense, average withdraw total/monthly
figure out leading zero error for days (current fix is that they are just strings)
create matplot date for each transaction class object
print out scatter graph of total and monthly expenditures
plot of distribution of expenses?
message for 0 entries in net_balance
String processor to break up 'descriptions' regex?
